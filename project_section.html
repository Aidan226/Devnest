      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-2" style="font-family: Inter, Inter Fallback">In this project, our aim is to build a modern tip calculator. 
        The project's primary interface comprises a container labeled "Tip Calculator" with two input fields: one for the bill amount and the other for the tip percentage.
        The tip calculator has a modern design that is styled using CSS.
        We utilized JavaScript to obtain the values of the two input fields and calculate the total amount based on these values.
